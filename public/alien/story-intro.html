            My name is Brian the Eater of Worlds. 
            For ten years, my race battled eachother by sending in our bodies to fight for us. 
            We removed our brains from our bodies and put our brains into mobile stasis chambers.
            When we awoke, we discovered all of our bodies were destroyed.  
            We were no longer able to continue fighting. </div>

            We were forced to stop the civil war and work together to find a new planet to live on - a planet that wasn't ruined.
            We have found what looks like a blue marble covered in moss.
            After listening in on the inhabitants of this planet, we believe that we have deciphered their primitive language.  </div>

            We have sent an audio signal into their atmosphere to shape their 
            “clouds” or “cotton candy” (we aren't 100% sure what the human call them) 
            to ask if we can use their planet.
