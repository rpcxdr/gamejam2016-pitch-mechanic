        <div class="one-half column">My name is Tony the astrophysicist. 
            I'm in charge of looking for space signals. 
            I never thought that I'd actually find one. 
            Today, I picked up a weird audio signal echoing through the atmosphere. 
            The sound was so intense that it made the clouds change form. 
            Something was using our clouds to write a message. </div>

        <div class="one-half column">
         I tracked the audio to a spaceship orbiting our planet that I used to think was space junk.
          My next course of action is to sent a test signal back. </div>
