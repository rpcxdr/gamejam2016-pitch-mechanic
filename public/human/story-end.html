            The communication project went terribly wrong. Apparently cats looked like a puffball on a stick, and hands are these weird abstract shapes without fingers. 
            On the other hand, the aliens have have become great pets.  People put them in dog houses cages, and just need to feed them water and gerbil pellets.
            <br /><br />
            They only stand at about two feet tall so if we had to get rid of them itâ€™s just a hop, skip and a drop kick away.
